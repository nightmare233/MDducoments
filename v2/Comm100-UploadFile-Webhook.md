## Upload File Webhook

### Note
- When a user uploads a file to the server, the status of the file does not support downloading yet. The Ticketing/Live Chat system will need to pass the event with the uploaded file information to the defined webhook URL and need a response to check whether the post has been received successfully. 
- After the scan tool on your end finishes scanning the uploaded file, you will be able to return the webhook response directly. Another option is to call the restful API to change the status of the file according to the scanning result, or delete the attachment directly.
    - Live chat attachment API: 
        - put /api/v2/livechat/attachments/{guid}
        - delete /api/v2/livechat/attachments/{guid}
    - Ticket attachment API: 
        - put /api/v2/ticket/attachments/{guid}
        - delete /api/v2/ticket/attachments/{guid}
- The re-post mechanism: If the event of sending webhook fails, or no response is received, we have a Timer function to repost the event periodically, but the interval gradually extends longer and longer, until 3 days later when the re-post will come to a stop.
    - Immediately send the second post after the first webhook post fails.
    - The third post will be sent 1 minute after the second one fails.
    - The fourth post will be sent 10 minutes after the third one fails.
    - The fifth post will be sent 1 hour after the fourth one fails.
    - The sixth post will be sent 24 hours after the fifth one fails.
    - The seventh post will be sent 24 hours after the sixth one fails.
    - The last post will be sent 24 hours after the seventh one fails.
